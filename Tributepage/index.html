          Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman FRS (/ˈrɑːmən/;[1] 7 November 1888 –
          21 November 1970) was an Indian physicist known for his work in the
          field of light scattering.[2] Using a spectrograph that he developed,
          he and his student K. S. Krishnan discovered that when light traverses
          a transparent material, the deflected light changes its wavelength and
          frequency. This phenomenon, a hitherto unknown type of scattering of
          light, which they called "modified scattering" was subsequently termed
          the Raman effect or Raman scattering. Raman received the 1930 Nobel
          Prize in Physics for the discovery and was the first Asian to receive
          a Nobel Prize in any branch of science.

          In 1917, he was appointed as the first Palit Professor of Physics by
          Ashutosh Mukherjee at the Rajabazar Science College under the
          University of Calcutta. On his first trip to Europe, seeing the
          Mediterranean Sea motivated him to identify the prevailing explanation
          for the blue colour of the sea at the time, namely the reflected
          Rayleigh-scattered light from the sky, as being incorrect. He founded
          the Indian Journal of Physics in 1926. He moved to Bangalore in 1933
          to become the first Indian director of the Indian Institute of
          Science. He founded the Indian Academy of Sciences the same year. He
          established the Raman Research Institute in 1948 where he worked to
          his last days
